<p>In this last sem, the first time I conducted a business activity was when I did an Ent assessment for individuals, that is, I managed a business in selling nestum cheesecake through online via Instagram and WhatsApp. The business takes around 3 weeks long and alhamdulillah it does go well with a little bit of difficulty but I can handle it well. The lessons and experience that I had learn throughout these activities is that developing a self-confidence. I was able to develop a level of confidence to not be afraid of trying and not be afraid to fail. Fail once and twice, does not mean you will fail forever. After that, during those 3 weeks of experience, my time management skills were better than before. Furthermore, I also improve my social skills. When I’m with new people, I quickly get awkward because I don’t have any topics to talk or discuss, but with running this business, ideas come faster than expected because it is something that I’m kind of interested in.
