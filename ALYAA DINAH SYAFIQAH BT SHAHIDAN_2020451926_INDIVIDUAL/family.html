On the left is my older brother who has continued his studies in a degree at UUM, Sintok.The other side is myself (excuse my ugly face), the side of me is the person I love the most, my charming mama, her side is my firm but authoritative abah and lastly, is someone which I hope will fall down the drain after we had a fight during childhood time, my middle brother.

<font color="white" size"2">Second picture is during the same day as the first one. This one, we took a picture with my brothers and I's foster mother, since we were babies. My foster mom is the second woman which I loved the most after mama. She was very loving and generous. Although my brothers and I were very naughty, but she still took care of us like her own children. The one next to me, at the very front, those two people were her youngest children (older than the three of us). They are also close with us and we already consider them as our own sister and brother.

<font color="white" size"2">This blueest one is my cousins on mother's side. This side I was closest to when I was a child but not now because it just feels so awkward. This picture was taken during my Acaq feast, the eldest son of my motherâ€™s older sister.
